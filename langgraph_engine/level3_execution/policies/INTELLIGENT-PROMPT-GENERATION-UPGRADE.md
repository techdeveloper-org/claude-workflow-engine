# Intelligent Prompt Generation Upgrade
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Session ID:** SESSION-20260217-121025-AFV3

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Original Issue:**
Even with all execution system scripts fixed to detect UI/Dashboard keywords, if the **Prompt Generator** doesn't extract those keywords properly from user messages, the entire system fails.

**User feedback:**
> "Keywords agar sahi use ni huye to dikkat karega ye cheej. Isliye prompt generation ko itna powerful banao ki wo ache keywords use kare, warna skill/agents kabhi ni use honge."

## 🔍 Root Cause

### **Before (Weak Keyword Extraction):**

```python
# OLD METHOD (Simple substring matching)
def extract_keywords(self, message: str) -> List[str]:
    tech_keywords = ["spring boot", "postgresql", "ui", "dashboard"]
    found = [kw for kw in tech_keywords if kw in message_lower]
    return found
```

**Problems:**
1. ❌ Only direct keyword matching
2. ❌ No synonym mapping ("admin" doesn't match "admin panel")
3. ❌ No Hinglish support ("ni ara" not recognized)
4. ❌ No context enrichment ("overlapping" doesn't trigger "css", "layout")
5. ❌ No intent detection (can't infer "dashboard" from "admin wala")

**Result:**
```
Input: "admin wala ni ara, overlapping ho rahi hai"
Keywords: []  ❌ EMPTY!
Task Type: General Task  ❌ WRONG!
```

---

## ✅ Solution: 5-Phase Intelligent Extraction

### **Phase 1: Synonym Mapping (User Language → System Keywords)**

```python
synonym_map = {
    # UI/Dashboard synonyms
    "admin": ["admin panel", "dashboard", "ui", "frontend"],
    "panel": ["admin panel", "dashboard", "ui"],
    "overlapping": ["ui overlapping", "layout", "css", "design", "alignment"],
    "layout": ["ui", "design", "css", "frontend"],
    "not showing": ["ui", "display", "frontend", "visibility"],
    "missing": ["ui", "frontend", "display"],
    "button": ["ui", "frontend", "component"],
    "logout": ["authentication", "frontend", "ui"],
    "login": ["authentication", "frontend", "ui"],

    # Backend synonyms
    "api": ["rest", "api", "endpoint", "backend"],
    "database": ["database", "entity", "repository", "backend"],
    "service": ["microservice", "backend", "business logic"],
    "auth": ["authentication", "security", "jwt"]
}
```

**Impact:**
- "admin" → Automatically adds "admin panel", "dashboard", "ui", "frontend"
- "overlapping" → Automatically adds "ui overlapping", "layout", "css", "design", "alignment"

---

### **Phase 2: Direct Tech Keyword Detection**

```python
tech_keywords = [
    # Backend Java/Spring (existing)
    "spring boot", "postgresql", "redis", "jwt", "oauth",

    # Backend Python (NEW)
    "python", "flask", "django", "fastapi", "sqlalchemy",

    # Frontend (NEW)
    "html", "css", "javascript", "typescript", "react",
    "angular", "vue", "webpack", "vite",

    # UI/UX (NEW)
    "dashboard", "ui", "ux", "design", "layout", "interface",
    "responsive", "admin panel", "frontend", "bootstrap",
    "tailwind", "material-ui", "component"
]
```

**Impact:**
- Python/Flask/Django now detected
- Frontend frameworks detected
- UI/UX terms properly captured

---

### **Phase 3: Context-Based Enrichment**

```python
# If dashboard mentioned → add related UI keywords
if any(kw in message_lower for kw in ["dashboard", "admin panel", "admin"]):
    extracted_keywords.extend(["dashboard", "ui", "frontend", "admin panel"])

# If UI issue mentioned → add CSS/layout keywords
if any(kw in message_lower for kw in ["overlapping", "alignment", "position"]):
    extracted_keywords.extend(["css", "layout", "ui", "design"])

# If authentication mentioned → add security keywords
if any(kw in message_lower for kw in ["login", "logout", "auth", "token"]):
    extracted_keywords.extend(["authentication", "security", "frontend"])

# If Python/Flask detected → add web framework keywords
if any(kw in message_lower for kw in ["flask", "django", "python"]):
    extracted_keywords.extend(["python", "backend", "web app"])
```

**Impact:**
- Dashboard tasks automatically get UI keywords
- UI issues automatically get CSS/layout context
- Auth tasks get security context

---

### **Phase 4: Hinglish Detection (Indian English Support)**

```python
hinglish_map = {
    "ni ara": ["not showing", "missing", "ui", "frontend"],
    "ni aa raha": ["not showing", "missing", "ui", "frontend"],
    "dikkat": ["issue", "problem", "bug"],
    "theek": ["fix", "correct"],
    "banana": ["create", "development"],
    "banao": ["create", "development"],
    "karo": ["do", "execute"],
    "wala": ["related to", "component"]
}
```

**Impact:**
- "admin wala ni ara" → Correctly detected as UI/Dashboard issue
- "overlapping ho rahi hai" → Detected with UI context
- "logout ka button nahi hai" → Detected as auth + UI task

---

### **Phase 5: File Type Detection**

```python
# HTML/CSS/JS files → Frontend
if any(ext in message_lower for ext in [".html", ".css", ".js", "template"]):
    extracted_keywords.extend(["frontend", "ui", "web app"])

# Python files → Backend
if any(ext in message_lower for ext in [".py", ".java", ".ts"]):
    extracted_keywords.append("backend")
```

**Impact:**
- File extensions automatically trigger correct tech stack detection

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### **Test Case 1: Hinglish Message**

**Input:**
```
"admin wala ni ara, UI overlapping ho rahi hai, logout ni hai"
```

| Aspect | Before ❌ | After ✅ |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **Keywords** | [] | 15 keywords |
| **Task Type** | General Task | UI/UX |

| **Detects "wala"** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes → "related to" |
| **Enrichment** | ❌ None | ✅ "admin" → "dashboard", "ui", "frontend" |

**Keywords After:**
- admin panel, dashboard, ui, frontend (from "admin")
- ui overlapping, layout, css, design, alignment (from "overlapping")
- authentication, security (from "logout")
- not showing, missing (from "ni ara")
