## 🎯 COMPLEXITY DECISION MATRIX

### **SIMPLE Tasks (Score: 0-4)**

**Characteristics:**
- 1-3 files to create/modify
- Single entity
- No complex dependencies
- Standard CRUD or simple fix
- No integration points

**Decision:**
```
❌ Plan Mode: NOT NEEDED
✅ Action: Proceed directly to execution
📝 Reason: Task is straightforward, no planning overhead needed
```

**Examples:**
- "Fix a typo in README"
- "Add a simple validation rule"
- "Create a single entity"
- "Add a constant to enum"

**Output:**
```
📊 Complexity Analysis:
   Score: 3 (SIMPLE)
   Tasks: 2
   Files: 1-2

✅ DECISION: NO PLAN MODE NEEDED
   This task is straightforward and can be executed directly.

   Proceeding to execution...
```

---

### **MODERATE Tasks (Score: 5-9)**

**Characteristics:**
- 3-6 files to create/modify
- 1-2 entities
- Some dependencies
- Standard patterns available
- Minimal integration

**Decision:**
```
⚠️ Plan Mode: RECOMMEND-THEN-ASK
📝 Pattern: Analyze task signals, form recommendation, present with reasoning, ask to confirm
📝 Score 5-7: Lean toward direct proceed (standard patterns apply)
📝 Score 8-9: Lean toward plan mode (multiple concerns detected)
```

**User Prompt (RECOMMEND-THEN-ASK pattern):**
```
📊 Complexity Analysis:
   Score: 7 (MODERATE)
   Tasks: 5
   Files: 4

⚠️ MY RECOMMENDATION:
   I recommend proceeding directly because:
   - This follows existing patterns in the codebase
   - Only 4 files need changes
   - No cross-service impact detected

   Should I proceed, or would you prefer plan mode first?
```

**Score 8-9 Example:**
```
📊 Complexity Analysis:
   Score: 8 (MODERATE-HIGH)
   Tasks: 7
   Files: 6

⚠️ MY RECOMMENDATION:
   I recommend plan mode because:
   - Multiple concerns detected (multi-project, DB changes)
   - 6+ files across different modules
   - Planning will prevent rework

   Should I enter plan mode, or proceed directly?
```

**Examples:**
- "Create a simple CRUD API"
- "Add basic authentication"
- "Implement a new service method"
- "Add configuration for service"

---

### **COMPLEX Tasks (Score: 10-19)**

**Characteristics:**
- 7-15 files to create/modify
- 2-3 entities
- Multiple dependencies
- Cross-service integration
- Custom business logic

**Decision:**
```
✅ Plan Mode: STRONGLY RECOMMENDED
📝 Reason: Task complexity warrants upfront planning to ensure correct approach
```

**User Prompt:**
```
📊 Complexity Analysis:
   Score: 15 (COMPLEX)
   Tasks: 12
   Files: 10
   Phases: 4
   Dependencies: Multiple cross-file dependencies

✅ PLAN MODE RECOMMENDED:
   This task has significant complexity. I strongly recommend plan mode to:

   Benefits:
   ✅ Design implementation strategy upfront
   ✅ Identify potential issues early
   ✅ Ensure architectural alignment
   ✅ Review approach before coding
   ✅ Reduce rework risk

   Recommendation: ENTER PLAN MODE
   - Time: +10 minutes for planning
   - Risk reduction: High
   - Quality improvement: Significant

   Proceed with plan mode? (Yes/No)
   (You can skip, but it's recommended)
```

**Examples:**
- "Create complete CRUD API with validation"
- "Add JWT authentication to service"
- "Implement order processing workflow"
- "Create multi-service integration"

---

### **VERY COMPLEX Tasks (Score: 20+)**

**Characteristics:**
- 15+ files to create/modify
- 3+ entities
- Complex dependencies
- Multi-service integration
- Custom architecture needed
- High risk of mistakes

**Decision:**
```
🔴 Plan Mode: MANDATORY
📝 Reason: Task is too complex to execute safely without planning
```

**User Notification:**
```
📊 Complexity Analysis:
   Score: 24 (VERY COMPLEX)
   Tasks: 18
   Files: 15+
   Phases: 5+
   Dependencies: Complex cross-service dependencies
   Risk: HIGH

🔴 PLAN MODE REQUIRED:
   This task is very complex and REQUIRES planning before execution.

   Why mandatory:
   🔴 High risk of incorrect approach without planning
   🔴 Multiple architectural decisions needed
   🔴 Cross-service impacts require careful design
   🔴 Potential for significant rework if rushed

   I will now enter plan mode to:
   1. Explore codebase thoroughly
   2. Design implementation strategy
   3. Identify all dependencies
   4. Create detailed execution plan
   5. Get your approval before coding

   Entering plan mode automatically...
   [EnterPlanMode tool called]
```

**Examples:**
- "Implement complete authentication system"
- "Migrate database schema across all services"
- "Create new microservice with full integration"
- "Implement event-driven architecture"
- "Major refactoring across multiple services"

### **Example 4: VERY COMPLEX Task**

```
User: "Implement JWT authentication across all services with role-based access control"

Step 0: Prompt Generation ✅
Step 1: Task Breakdown ✅
    Base Score: 22
    Risk Factors:
    - Multi-service impact (+5)

    Adjusted Score: 34 (VERY COMPLEX)

Step 2: Plan Mode Suggestion
────────────────────────────────────────────
📊 COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS

Score: 34 (VERY COMPLEX)
Tasks: 25+
Files: 15+
Phases: 6
Services Affected: 4 (auth, user, product, gateway)

Risk Factors:
  ⚠️ Multi-service impact detected
  ⚠️ Security-critical changes
  ⚠️ No similar examples in codebase

🔴 PLAN MODE: REQUIRED (MANDATORY)
────────────────────────────────────────────

Task is too complex to execute safely without
planning.

Why this is mandatory:
🔴 HIGH: Wrong architectural decisions possible
🔴 HIGH: Missed critical security considerations
🔴 HIGH: Breaking changes to all services
🔴 HIGH: Major rework risk
🔴 HIGH: Potential production security issues

I will now enter plan mode to create a detailed
implementation plan. This will ensure we:
1. Design secure authentication architecture
2. Identify all cross-service impacts
3. Plan migration strategy for existing services
4. Create rollback plan
5. Review security best practices

Entering plan mode automatically...

## 🗂️ PLAN ARCHIVAL TO SESSION FOLDER (NEW - v2.0)

### **Overview**

When user enters plan mode and creates a plan, the plan is automatically archived to the session folder for permanent storage and continuity.

**Current Flow:**
```
EnterPlanMode called
    ↓
Plan created: ~/.claude/plans/{random-name}.md
    ↓
[Session ends]
    ↓
plan-session-archiver.py detects plan
    ↓
Plan copied to: ~/.claude/memory/logs/sessions/{SESSION_ID}/plan.md
    ↓
session-summary.json updated with plan metadata
    ↓
Plan permanently linked to session! ✅
```

### **Why This Matters**

1. **Context Continuity** - Plan stays with session data
2. **Future Reference** - Can recall plan when session resumes
3. **Smart Review** - PR review can use plan context
4. **Archive** - Plans move from temporary to permanent storage
5. **Searchability** - Query "Find all sessions with plans"

### **Session Folder Structure After Plan Creation**

```
~/.claude/memory/logs/sessions/SESSION-20260305-113248-W5K4/
├── session-summary.json          (existing - now includes plan_info)
├── session-summary.md            (existing)
├── flow-trace.json               (from Step 3.5)
├── plan.md                       ✅ NEW - archived plan
└── plan-archival-metadata.json   ✅ NEW - archival details
```

### **Plan Metadata Stored in session-summary.json**

```json
{
  "plan_info": {
    "plan_created": true,
    "plan_mode_required": true,
    "plan_filename": "quirky-noodling-falcon.md",
    "plan_archived_at": "2026-03-05T11:32:48.123456",
    "plan_location": "~/.claude/memory/logs/sessions/SESSION-20260305-113248-W5K4/plan.md",
    "plan_size_bytes": 8192,
    "plan_status": "archived"
  }
}
```

### **Archival Script**

**File:** `scripts/architecture/03-execution-system/02-plan-mode/plan-session-archiver.py`

**Responsibility:**
- Detect when plan mode has created a plan file
- Copy from ~/.claude/plans/ to session folder
- Create metadata record
- Update session-summary.json
- Graceful error handling

**Function Signature:**
```python
def archive_plan_to_session(session_id: str) -> dict:
    """
    Archive the most recent plan from ~/.claude/plans/ to session folder.

    Args:
        session_id (str): Current session ID (e.g., SESSION-20260305-113248-W5K4)

    Returns:
        dict: {
            'success': bool,
            'plan_file': str (original path),
            'archived_to': str (session path),
            'plan_name': str (original random name),
            'size_bytes': int,
            'timestamp': str (ISO format),
            'error': str (if failed)
        }
    """
```

### **Integration Points**

1. **stop-notifier.py** (session end hook)
   - Calls archiver before session cleanup
   - Updates session-summary.json
   - Logs archival result

2. **session-summary-manager.py** (session tracking)
   - Adds plan metadata to JSON
   - Updates plan_info block
   - Records archival timestamp

### **Benefits for Smart Review (Step 4.5)**

When PR review runs, it can access the plan:

```python
# In github_pr_workflow.py _smart_code_review():
plan_path = f"~/.claude/memory/logs/sessions/{session_id}/plan.md"
if Path(plan_path).exists():
    with open(plan_path, 'r') as f:
        plan_content = f.read()
        # Use plan context in review:
        # - Check if code matches plan design
        # - Verify all plan steps implemented
        # - Ensure architectural decisions followed
```

### **Error Handling**

| Scenario | Handling |
|----------|----------|
| No plan file found | Log info (plan not created), continue |
| Multiple plans created | Archive newest one |
| Permission denied | Log error, graceful failure |
| Session ID unknown | Use UNKNOWN, log error |
| Disk space full | Log error, don't fail session |
| File already exists | Overwrite with log note |

### **Success Criteria**

- ✅ Plan archived to session folder
- ✅ Plan metadata in session-summary.json
- ✅ Original plan in ~/.claude/plans/ preserved
- ✅ No data loss
- ✅ Can find plan by session ID
- ✅ Smart review can use plan context
